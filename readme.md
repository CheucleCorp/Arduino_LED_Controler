Welcome to my "Arduino LED Controller"

This is a project that allows you to control a led pluged on an Arduino Board throught your computer. Instead of use the serial interface provide with the Arduino IDE, I've created a graphicalinterface, in Visual C#.

If you want to run it, you can send the programm to the Arduino, connect a led in a digital pin (13 is the default one) and connect your Arduino to your PC by USB.
Then, run the .exe file and enjoy !


The Git repository is composed by two sub-folders : 

-> Arduino Software, wich contains the programm to send to the Arduino Board. For more information, see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno

-> Computer Software, wich contains the programm that run on the computer (Windows OS) and allow you to control the LED pluged on the Arduino Board
